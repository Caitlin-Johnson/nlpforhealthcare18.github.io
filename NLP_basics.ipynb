      "This inspection took place on 9, 10 and 11 October 2017 and was unannounced. During the last inspection \n",
      "on 1 February 2017 we found the service was in breach of four legal requirements and regulations \n",
      "associated with the Health and Social Care Act 2008. We found that people who used the service were not \n",
      "protected against the risks associated with their care and treatment. Medicines were not managed safely. \n",
      "There were not always adequate staffing levels at meal times. Staff were not receiving consistent support \n",
      "through regular supervision. Not all people were supported to maintain their personal dignity. \n",
      "\n",
      "At a previous inspection in July 2016, we found the service to be inadequate overall. We placed Apthorp Care\n",
      "Centre into special measures and imposed a condition on the provider's registration to submit monthly \n",
      "audit reports to the Care Quality Commission (CQC). Following the inspection in February 2017, although \n",
      "some improvement had been made, the service remained in special measures and the conditions on the \n",
      "provider's registration remained in place. \n",
      "\n",
      "This inspection was carried out within the six-month time frame to check if improvements to the quality of \n",

      "action to achieve compliance with some of the regulations previously identified as non-compliant during \n",
      "the comprehensive inspection in February 2017. However, we found repeated breaches of Regulations 17 \n",

      "Apthorp Care Centre is a purpose built residential care home that is registered to provide accommodation \n",

      "regulations associated with the Health and Social Care Act 2008, to look at the overall quality of the service, \n",
      "and to provide a rating for the service under the Care Act 2014.\n",
      "\n",
      "This inspection took place on 9, 10 and 11 October 2017 and was unannounced. The inspection team \n",
      "consisted of a lead inspector, three supporting inspectors, a pharmacist inspector, a specialist nurse advisor \n",
      "and two experts by experience. An expert by experience is a person who has personal experience of using or \n",
      "caring for someone who uses this type of care service.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before the inspection we reviewed the information we held about the service such as statutory notifications \n",
      "and safeguarding alerts. We also looked at the action plan that the service had provided to the CQC \n",
      "following the last inspection and the monthly updates received. We obtained feedback from the local \n",

      "\n",
      "During the inspection we spoke to 30 people who used the service, 10 relatives, 20 care workers, \n",
      "housekeeping and maintenance staff, four activities staff, three floor managers, two deputy managers, the \n",

      "At our last inspection on 1 February 2017, we found that staffing levels were not sufficient around meal times\n",
      "to ensure that people were supported to eat and drink. We found at this inspection that although some \n",
      "improvements had been made and that there were sufficient staff available in the home overall to safely \n",
      "ensure people's care needs were met, we remained concerned about how staff were deployed to ensure \n",
      "people received support in a timely manner during meal times. \n",
      "\n",
      "We spent time looking at the staffing arrangements in place to support people living at Apthorp Care Centre.\n",
      "We spoke with people who used the service, relatives, and staff, looked at staffing rotas, the dependency \n",
      "tool and observed the support offered throughout the day.\n",
      "\n",
      "We observed lunch time across three days in all areas of the home. We found that in areas where people \n",
      "needed additional support to eat or required staff to prompt them, this was not always happening. We \n",
      "observed that one person waited in excess of thirty minutes to be supported by care staff after their lunch \n",
      "had been served, although it was noted that the staff member apologised to the person for the delay when \n",
      "they started to assist them to eat. We also observed that in one flat, two care staff were supporting five \n",
      "people to eat, two of whom were entirely dependent on staff for support with eating. Three people required \n",
      "prompting and encouragement to eat and were refusing their meals. Both staff members attempted to \n",
      "support all five people; however, it meant that people were receiving their meals in a stop-start fashion and \n",
      "food was left to get cold. We observed some senior staff members assist care staff during lunchtime; \n",
      "however, we received consistent feedback from staff and a professional involved with the service that senior \n",
      "staff did not usually assist at mealtimes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the last inspection, we found that the service no longer relied on agency staff to ensure staffing levels \n",
      "were at a safe level. The regional director told us that this had been a significant achievement in stabilising \n",
      "the workforce and ensuring that the quality of care improved. Rotas confirmed that 21 care staff were on \n",
      "duty in the early part of the day, 20 care staff in the afternoon and evenings with nine care staff on duty at \n",
      "night which was reflected in the provider's dependency tool. We received a mixed response from people \n",
      "who used the service when asked if they thought there were enough staff. Comments received from people \n",
      "included, \"Sometimes a bit short. Not a big thing. Carers come and chat and talk when doing something\", \n",
      "\"Yes I do think there is enough\", \"No it is woeful. There is not enough staff here\" and \"Staff very helpful and \n",
      "enough of them.\" Relatives told us, \"I noticed recently new staff recruited i.e. floor managers and they take \n",
      "notice\" and \"They ring me and keep me updated and you get continuity of staff. All good now. Staff were \n",
      "really poor and there was bad treatment; none of it now.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "We discussed our concerns with the home management who advised that they recognised staffing at \n",
      "mealtimes was a challenge and following the inspection, submitted an action plan detailing that mealtimes \n",
      "would be protected and all staff in the home including admin and domestic staff, with appropriate training, \n",
      "would be drafted in to support with mealtimes. \n",

      "\n",
      "At our last inspection in February 2017, we found that although risk assessments were identifying most risks \n",
      "associated with people's care and treatment, there were instances were risks had not been considered \n",
      "appropriately. At this inspection, we found that the provider had mostly addressed the issue. \n",
      "\n",
      "Risk assessments were person centred, up to date and reviewed regularly. They covered risks to people such\n",
      "as skin integrity, moving and handling, falls, risks associated with the use of bedrails, smoking, alcohol \n",
      "consumption and health conditions such as diabetes, mental health conditions and associated behaviours. \n",
      "Staff were able to explain how they would work with people's identified risks. For example, one person's \n",
      "care record detailed that the person had been identified as being at risk of falls. Staff supported this person \n",
      "regularly to ensure the person continued to maintain their independence and felt safe. The person told us, \n",
      "\"The staff checks on me during the day and at night and accompanies me to the toilet. At home I used to \n",
      "have small accidents. Not here.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "Another person's care record indicated that they were at risk of developing pressure ulcers. Their care record\n",
      "specified they should be supported to turn over in bed to relieve pressure on their skin. They were supported\n",
      "to do this every two hours. Staff had signed a chart to confirm that they had done this. There were \n",
      "repositioning charts for the past ten days confirming that they had done so consistently. The person's \n",
      "relative told us, \"There has been a lot of improvement in [person's] ulcer. I know this because she is no \n",
      "longer in pain.\"  A health professional told us, \"The wound has improved, there is strong evidence that the \n",
      "staff are turning [person] regularly and changing [person's] pads.\" Staff had also documented that the \n",
      "wounds 'showed signs of healing'. Staff we spoke to knew how to refer people to the district nurse and \n",
      "tissue viability nurse in order to obtain advice about the prevention and management of pressure ulcers \n",
      "when required. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, we found some inconsistencies in how identified risks were managed to ensure people stayed \n",
      "safe. We observed two occasions where people requiring supervision for certain tasks, were left unattended. \n",
      "One of these occasions was where a person required supervision whilst eating their meal. The person's care \n",
      "plan stated, \"Staff need to support [Person], as they have a tendency to put too much into their mouth.\" We \n",
      "spoke to a staff member nearby who told us that they knew the person required supervision but they were \n",
      "unable to do so fully as they had to attend to the needs of other people also. \n",
      "\n",
      "There were generic and environmental risk assessments for all areas of the home. Care had been taken to \n",
      "identify and manage risks around the home, but in some cases practice observed fell short of these control \n",
      "measures. We observed people walking into the open plan kitchen in flat one, with no staff supervision. The \n",
      "kitchen in flat three had a keypad entry system for the door, but this was observed to be left on the latch or \n",
      "wide open on several occasions during the inspection. The kitchens in all the flats contained small \n",
      "appliances such as microwaves, kettles and toasters. Records showed that the small appliances had been \n",
      "tested to ensure they were electrically safe to use, but there were no specific risk assessments to ensure that \n",
      "people who were able to enter the kitchens were safe to do so.\n",
      "\n",
      "We raised our concerns regarding mitigating risk management to the home management team who \n",

      "not clear from review of documentation that any actions had been taken to escalate concerns regarding low\n",
      "fluid intake. We saw that the local authority had raised fluid intake monitoring with the provider on two \n",
      "occasions following the last inspection, however, the provider had failed to adequately implement a robust \n",

      "people had access to drinks and were regularly offered drinks by staff throughout the inspection which was \n",
